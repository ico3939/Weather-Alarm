# Weather-Alarm
An iOS alarm app meant to play a different tone based on the current weather condition

Milestone1:
- Features:
  - Ask for the user's location
  - Connect to Darsky ForecastIO API to grab weather information from the user's location
  - The user can choose a time from the date-time picker
  - Once the time is chosen, the timer will begin to count down
  - Once the timer reaches zero, the summary of the current weather is displaced

- For future:
  - add ability to play sound when finished
    - put in some default music
  - create separate screens for picking time
  - refactor some code into separate classes
